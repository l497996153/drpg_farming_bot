This bot is intended to showcase the method which can be used to farm digimon in the world on Digimon RPG. The bot will locate the digimon, battle, summon other digis for experience, and pick up items when the battle concludes. There is no GUI for this bot as it was never formally finished. I'm releasing this because I've had some people ask for a digimon farming bot. You can use this as a base to understand how to farm digimon for your use case. This bot supports farming Indaramon and Jyureimon. I'm not interested in performing any more work with this project but please ask if you have any questions about how it works.
